# Meeting Minutes Skill

A structured skill for [Claude](https://claude.ai) that transforms raw meeting transcripts into professional, clean minutes — with built-in preflight checks, duplicate detection, and user checkpoints at every stage. Always check the outputs to ensure they accurately reflect what was discussed.

---

## What it does

Paste in a raw transcript (Teams, Otter, Zoom, handwritten notes) and the skill walks you through:

1. **Preflight** — scans for speaker identities, spelling variants, off-topic content, and unresolved items before a single minute is drafted
2. **Draft** — produces structured minutes grouped by topic, not chronology, with clear action owners
3. **Critique** — detects duplicate, fragmented, or overlapping items using a trigger-based confidence system
4. **Finalise** — applies your merge decisions and outputs a clean `.docx`

---

## Key features

### Preflight scan
Before drafting, the skill identifies:
- **Speakers and their roles** — maps transcript labels to Speaker 1, 2 or 3 or Initials where inputted by user.
- **Mentioned but not present** — people referenced who may still receive actions (e.g. structural engineers, contractors, suppliers)
- **Spelling variants** — catches AI transcription errors and inconsistent naming across the transcript, proposes a canonical form for each, and locks it in before drafting
- **Attribution gaps** — flags moments where it genuinely can't tell who is speaking
- **Off-topic content** — silently excludes social chat, dropped calls, and filler
- **Open items** — surfaces unresolved decisions for an Outstanding Items section

### Duplicate detection
Uses a T1–T8 trigger system to assess merge risk:

| Code | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| T1 | Different action owners |
| T2 | Both items contain numbers/dimensions |
| T3 | Conditional language (if/when/unless) |
| T4 | Different trades or disciplines |
| T5 | >15 words length difference |
| T6 | Caveat or qualification present |
| T7 | Different timeframes |
| T8 | External document referenced |

- 0 triggers → auto-merge
- 1 trigger (not T6) → auto-merge
- T6 alone → always flag (caveats hide liability)
- 2+ triggers → flag for user decision

### Interactive checkpoints
Uses Claude's multi-choice widget interface for merge decisions — **Merge / Keep separate / Other** — rather than typing responses, so reviews are fast.

### Action ownership
- **Noted** — informational, no action required
- **TBC** — action needed, owner not yet agreed
- **Outstanding** — no decision reached, grouped in a dedicated section

## How to use

### In Claude.ai (with skills enabled)
1. Add `SKILL.md` to your Claude skills folder
2. Start a new conversation and paste your transcript
3. Claude will run preflight automatically, then guide you through the rest

### Manually
1. Open a Claude conversation
2. Paste the contents of `SKILL.md` followed by your transcript
3. Claude will follow the workflow

## File structure

```

├── SKILL.md      # The skill definition — all logic lives here
└── README.md     # This file
```

## Output

The final output is a formatted `.docx` file containing:

- **Header table** — project, date, attendees, mentioned-but-not-present parties, meeting type, minutes by
- **Numbered item tables** — grouped by topic/trade, with item text and action owner per row
- **Outstanding Items section** — if any unresolved items were flagged at preflight
- **Footer note** — standard correction window notice

## Workflow overview

```
Transcript input
      │
      ▼
Part 0: Preflight
  → Speakers, spelling variants, open items
  → Widget: confirm canonicals + unknown speakers
      │
      ▼
Part A: Draft minutes
  → Apply canonical spellings throughout
  → TBC / Outstanding for unowned/unresolved items
      │
      ▼
Checkpoint 1: Proceed to critique?
      │
      ▼
Part B: Critique & deduplication
  → T1–T8 trigger system
  → Widget per flagged pair: Merge / Keep separate / Other
      │
      ▼
Part C: Finalise
  → Apply decisions, clean up, output .docx
```
